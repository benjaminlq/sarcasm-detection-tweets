## I. Problem Statement
Sarcasm is the usage of language that normally signifies the opposite to mock or convey contempt. Understanding sarcasm is important as typical sentimental analysis fails to capture the underlying intensions or meanings. In this project, we tackled sarcasm detection on SemEval-2018 (Task 3) English Twitter datasets.

## II. Dataset
The dataset used is English Twitter Dataset provided at SemEval-2018 Task 3 by Van Hee et al. (2018). The dataset consists of 4617 English tweets from 2676 unique users. The tweets are manually labeled using a fine-grained annotation scheme. The dataset consists of a training (3833 tweets) and a testing set (784 tweets) with an 80/20 split ratio.
